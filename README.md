C<sup>3</sup>DNA Platform for AEM Customers
=======
 
   * Version: 1.0.0
   * Date: March 29<sup>th</sup>, 2017

C<sup>3</sup>DNA brings end-to-end Application Lifecycle Management to
Enterprise Private or Hybrid Clouds. Both existing applications i.e. pets and
new cloud-native applications i.e. cattle can be on-boarded, deployed across
clouds and then managed via policies to provide developers and application
owners with an application-centric visibility and dynamic policy-based real-time
management with instant cross-cloud mobility.

This runner job installs the platform component only. See also the [Controller Component][c3dna-controller].

This version is for AEM customers.

See the [Getting Started Guide][guide] for further details.
